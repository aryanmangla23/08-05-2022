Depressing Day till 2. Worked on waste and ran. MY CALVES ARE SO MUCH BETTER. The only downside is my achilles tendon hurts or feels stretched when i run.

1:12 am. What am I been feeling? I think it's a want for school to come back. like not 22nd but tmrw. The desire to see my best friends on a daily basis. To not be lonely. The desire for the only messages being reels and kevin saying k. The desire for us to be able to have normal convos and ask, "hey how was your day. did you do anything interesting" instead of "k".

Depressing Day till 2. Worked on waste and ran. MY CALVES ARE SO MUCH BETTER. The only downside is my achilles tendon hurts or feels stretched when i run.

1:12 am. What am I been feeling? I think it's a want for school to come back. like not 22nd but tmrw. The desire to see my best friends on a daily basis. To not be lonely. The desire for the only messages I see to not be reels and kevin saying k. The desire for us to be able to have normal convos and ask, "hey how was your day. did you do anything interesting" instead of "k".

3:12 am. today is not a good day, but that's fine. I just want to curl into a ball, but not cry. Cuz im not sad, I'm just facing some emotion i cant identify. weird. what did i do today that makes me feel this way. why do all my activities in the day only come back to affect me during midnight. why does my brain only work during night time. so wack. kay

I was sad, pissed, understanding, worried beyond my mind, and then furious. Which feelings is sticking onto me rn? 

I think it is the last two, worried and mad. To not be taken seriously, to be holding everything is what truly takes courage. People mock others that keep things to themself. When in reality it takes courage for someone to dump a bomb about their problems on people, but it takes even greater bravery to keep things to yourself. **To not tend the wound.**  

To thank a friend. Why are you thanking. It's a duty for friends to help each other in whatever way they can. The right word people mean to talk about is gratefulness. To be grateful that him, her, and them are great friends that care for me and help me through my toughest time. But don't tell them that. True friendship is to repay back with no expectation. If a person didn't care, they wouldn't be friends. 

Lastly, to think that you are burden is beyond disgusting. I regret doing this 5 months ago, when I felt like a burden to my family. Constant pain. I wish for no one to ever go through that feeling of being a burden. Unless that isn't the reason for feeling like a burden. Maybe it's something else or it is me evaluationg every possible reason for a person to feel that way. Hmm. **Past, Present, and Future** Maybe that's why.
